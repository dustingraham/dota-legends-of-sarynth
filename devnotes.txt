Feedback

- Better documentation.

- Some way to test dedicated servers on local machine. Important since there are differences between dedicated server and local machine running the game. Such as missed precached assets look fine on local machine, but are missing in dedicated server.

- Change log for editor/tools/addons.

Console in live game.
 Add -console to launch command shortcut.

Bugs:
- Multiplayer - They said they picked sorcerer. But it did not create the hero for them.

Quest ideas that are not "kill 10 creatures"

Collect supplies (from various boxes) then help reinforce the walls (various spots on wall where you need to interact.
Destroy corrupted seed pods. Collect healthy seed samples.

Stances. (firetoad)
Raise Shield (Toggle)
 - Off: Passively grants you 20% chance to crit for 200% (abilities can also crit).
 - On: Passively grants you 60% incoming damage reduction, abilities generate 400% threat.

Difference between Q and E? Q doesn't stun. Both seem like near range aoe.
AOE particle is really large.

Two players, share exp, don't get level 3 in time for second quest.

Select companion to see gear.

Worgs should appear aggressive.

Mana costs are irrelevant.

Spam clicking right click, cancels attack.

Spam click on abilities, cancels abilities.

During movement, cancels regen.

Right click or double click to equip.

Keep Focus Target -- Just figure out the spammy retargeting issue. Don't re-issue command if it is the same.

Mouse over unit press Q should go to that unit, rather than focus unit.

Omni has no tankability and no damage.

Showcase mode "i" broke camera lock.

Showcase mode, skillbar disappeared.

Explain right-click to sell first time visiting shopkeeper.

Should creeps really have up-hill vision?

Wasted space in town.

Should block northern direction.

HP is too far away from skills. Resource management is hard.

Try swapping minimap and HP bar perhaps.

Threat system needed. Even when grinding creeps, so paladin can save me when low life.

Consider increasing speed of manabird on longer distances.

Give heroes double the stat growth.

Level 8 creatures still hard.

Inventory: Right-Click for menu, to drop or equip. Left click to equip.

Bosses (Scar, Kobold) drop nice item, but sucks for team. Should be individual drops. Maybe a treasure chest that glows, loot for all.

Hotkey to drop, like alt-left click with a note about it.

Power jumps are too large. To smooth it out, increase power slightly with levels.

Spider web distracts, makes folks turn right.

Omni AOE spells suck.

Q keep as is, just buff AOE.
W is fine.
E heal or thorns.
D is fine max hp scaling regen is not relevant at higher levels.
F is good.

Need the ability to compare items quickly. (Show both equipped tooltip and hover tooltip?)

Location overlay when dragging an item to equip is not visible once an item is equipped, add outer glow?

Add Purge to paladin. Maybe talent addition.

Went into wolf spiders when needed plated arachnid. How to better guide users towards quest locations.

Move all yellows to the right side.

After finishing virulent queen, quest to go to next area.

Figure out a way to indicate direction of next quest. Like where the plated spider is.
