Feedback

- Better documentation.

- Some way to test dedicated servers on local machine. Important since there are differences between dedicated server and local machine running the game. Such as missed precached assets look fine on local machine, but are missing in dedicated server.

- Change log for editor/tools/addons.

Console in live game.
 Add -console to launch command shortcut.

TODOs:
- Delete save slot. (Multiple requests.)

- Display last save time. (Quit and Save button?)

- Implement shop vendor for selling items.

- Right click on item in inventory to equip it.
- Flash inventory icon until user opens it for the first item. (Any new item?)
- Display debuff when standing in fire in druid fight.
- Druid should say more things. Perhaps charge at player.
- Fix sword orientation in druid room.
- Southwest druid tower did not open correctly.
- Tower opening animation is jerky.

- High level archer fires too fast, normal attack questionably more powerful than using skills.

- Should show "ending in 10 seconds" to both(all) players.
- Remove disconnected hero after some time. (Do not allow other players to select or use.)
